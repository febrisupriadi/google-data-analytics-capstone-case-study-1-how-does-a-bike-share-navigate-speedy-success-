Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study

A Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

📘 About

This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. It analyzes historical bike-trip data from Cyclistic (2019-Q1 and 2020-Q1), a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, to identify how annual members and casual riders use bikes differently.
The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations that help convert casual riders into annual members, supporting Cyclistic’s long-term growth.

🧭 Process

The analysis follows the six steps of the data analysis process:

Ask – Define the business problem and key questions.

Prepare – Collect 12 months of Cyclistic trip data.

Process – Clean and organize the data using R or spreadsheet tools.

Analyze – Identify usage trends and patterns between user types.

Share – Create clear visualizations and communicate insights.

Act – Recommend marketing strategies based on findings.

🧰 Tools Used

R / RStudio – data cleaning, analysis, and visualization

Google Sheets / Excel – initial data exploration

Tableau / Data Studio – data visualization

GitHub – project documentation and version control

📊 Key Findings

Annual members tend to use bikes more frequently and for shorter, consistent trips.

Casual riders use bikes longer and mostly on weekends for leisure.

Conversion opportunities exist through targeting casual riders with flexible membership offers.

💡 Recommendations

Develop marketing campaigns focused on weekend riders.

Offer membership discounts or trial periods for casual users.

Use digital media and app notifications to promote membership benefits.

🏁 Outcome

This project demonstrates the ability to perform end-to-end data analysis — from data cleaning to actionable business recommendations — using real-world datasets and professional analytical tools.
